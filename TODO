Driving
- Encoders - AMTs
- RIO based Motion Profiling

Autos
- Cross auto line
- Shoot 3 balls
- Shoot 3 balls, intake at trench, and shoot.
- Shoot 3 balls, take balls off bumps. [Bad idea because bumps]

Intake
- Run a motor

Hopper
- Run a motor perpetually
- Maybe add a PID

Lifter
- Run a motor

Shooter
- Run flywheel with a PID
- Manually changing the turret
- PID control for automatic turret aim
- Hood control with a PID

Climber
* Awaiting design

Control Panel
- Have a camera or a color sensor
- Run motor to turn wheel rotional (maybe automatic with a PID)
- Positional control (just turn wheel slowly until the color is reached)

Sensors
- Limelight
- Color Sensor (?)
- Webcam
- 2x Encoders (Drivetrain)
- 1x Encoder (Control Panel)
- 1x Encoder (Turret Ring)
- 1x Encoder (Hood Control)
- 1x Encoder (Elevator Control)
