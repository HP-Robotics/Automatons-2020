X - Not priority

Driving
- (Done) Encoders - AMTs
X RIO based Motion Profiling

Autos
- Cross auto line
X Shoot 3 balls
X Shoot 3 balls, intake at trench, and shoot.
X Shoot 3 balls, take balls off bumps. [Bad idea because bumps]

Intake
- (Done) Run a motor

Hopper
- (Done) Current Protection
- Maybe detect a jam and run backwards for a little bit

Lifter
- Run a motor

Shooter
- (Done?) Run flywheel with a PID
- (Done) Manually changing the turret
- Manually changing turret angle to specified angle from encoder, not with motor power (Waiting on encoder fix)
- Install Limelight (Hood or ring?)
- PID control for automatic turret aim (Waiting on encoder fix)
- Absolute position for turret (Through-bore encoder)
- (Doing) Hood control with a PID (Waiting on Motor install and gear install)
    - RoboRIO WPI PID class with Absolute Encoder

Climber
* Awaiting design

Control Panel
X Design control panel manipulator
X Have a camera or a color sensor
X Run motor to turn wheel (maybe automatic with a PID)
X Positional control (just turn wheel slowly until the color is reached)

Sensors
X Limelight
X Color Sensor (?)
- Webcam
- (Done) 2x Encoders (Drivetrain)
- 1x Encoder (Control Panel)
- (Broken, need to be repaired) 1x Encoder (Turret Ring)
- (Done) 1x Encoder (Hood Control)
- 1x Encoder (Elevator Control)

Programming Next Steps:
- (Done?) Combine turret with Shooter
- Turn SpinUpCommand into ShooterCommand
